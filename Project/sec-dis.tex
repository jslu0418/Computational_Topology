In this survey, we reviewed recent progress on several applications of topology in robot motion planning, namely, the topological complexity of the configuration space in motion planning, topological maps for building motion planners or producing concise route, approximate homotopic path similarity in motion planning.
We then went through the basic setting of the problem, introduced configuration spaces of some classic mechanical system, and explored the properties of four topological complexities of the topological space.
There are some open problems regarding the homotopy invariant \(\mathbf{TC}(X)\) such as the rational version of \(\mathbf{TC}(X)\), symmetric motion planning, as well as motion planning in aspherical spaces, see survey~\cite{farber2006topology}.

Choset and Rizzi applied their task decomposition strategy to two classes of practical problems to build ``good'' topological maps. In the future, we can expect more problems can be solved with task decomposition and some more general techniques be designed in order to exploit this tool on motion planning. On the other hand, the practical interest of considering multiple homotopically distinct paths in certain problems motivate us to explore more on finding efficient way to compute a good approximation of the homotopic path similarity and developing algorithms that produce homotopically distinct paths through these metrics.
